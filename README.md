# Process Writeup

## Name: Wilson Huang
## Course: APCSA
## Period: 7
## Concept: Unit 5

### Introduction
In APCSA (Advanced Placement Computer Science A), we are learning about Java. Learning Java is somewhat similar to Javascript; so I am familiar with some of the code. In unit 5 we have been learning on how to write classes. This unit it has been challenging for me to understand because new concepts and vocab were presented to me which was confusing at the beginning. In this write up I will take you through some of the challenges I had when learning in unit 5 and the exam I had at the end

### Challenge 1
One challenge I had when learning about unit 5 is finding the reason why and when do use a void statment. To find the asnwer to this I watched this [youtube vidoe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14Cfx3fpH-w) and I found out that you use a void method when you do not want to return anything in the class. 
#### Void Method
```java
public static void printMessage() {
        System.out.println("This is a void method. It doesn't return anything");
    }
```
#### Non Void Method
```java
public static String printMessage() {
        return "This is a void method. It doesn't return anything";
    }`
```
